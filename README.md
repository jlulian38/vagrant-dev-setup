# vagrant-dev-setup
Julian R. Moore's vagrant development environment setup script.

Note that this makes a bunch of assumptions about the host environment, namely:
  * VMWare Workstation is installed
  * The Vagrant VMWare Workstation Plugin is installed
  * There's an ssh executable on your %PATH% (I use CyGwin for this because I like the terminal better than cmd.exe)
